        <p>My experience writing code has led me to some preferred development practices:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Feature development should be test-driven and new code should be written in small, easily testable units. Shortcuts which add technical debt should be avoided, with rare exceptions.</li>
          <li>Release cycles should be kept short, thus providing the team with a clear focus and giving stakeholders an immediate opportunity for feedback.</li>
          <li>All aspects of the development cycle which can be automated should be automated (eg. continuous testing/integration, code generators for any common implementation patterns). This avoids human error and allows developers to spend their time solving new problems.</li>
          <li>Teams should be kept small and tightly knit. Pairing on code whenever possible leads to higher code quality and increased communication among team members. A passionate, highly communicative development team achieves the best results.</li>
          <li>Any ideas that lead to suboptimal results should be deprecated in favor of better ideas.</li>

        <p>Mostly though, I just try to contribute in a way that seems helpful. I'll talk to teachers, administrators and students in an effort to figure out what that is.</p>
